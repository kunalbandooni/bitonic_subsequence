# bitonic_subsequence

The bitonic subsequence is the sequence which first increases, then decreases.

Problem:- You have to find the longest bitonic subsequence in a given array.

Input:-

    9

    1 3 5 7 4 3 5 2 6
    
Output:-

    7
    
Explanation:-

    Longest subsequence of an array is: 1 3 5 7 4 3 2
    Hence, total length being 7
